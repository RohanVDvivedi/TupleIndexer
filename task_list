** PICKED TASKS

** REVAMP SORTER
   * api
     * insert_tuple_in_sorter
     * insert_sorted_run_in_sorter
     * finalize_any_partial_run
     * get_sorted_runs_count
     * merge_runs_in_sorter
     * delete_sorter

** OTHER DATABASE DATASTRUCTURE TASKS (VERY IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE OF PROJECT)
 * Rtree will be supported
   * very similar to b+tree, n dimensional data can be searched, inserted, deleted, no least_keys_page_id required
   * splits and merges happen according to the minimal increase in interior node bounding boxes
   * inserts walk down only 1 path of the tree, trying to minimize the increased area
   * searches walk down a tree, and maintain a stack, releasing locks only if only 1 entry is to be scaned in the interior node, in READ_LOCK
     * next, prev and get_curr are always supported, in WRITE_LOCK and READ_LOCK_INTERIOR_WRITE_LOCK_LEAF deletes and inserts (if we are in right rectangle), updates are supported
   * you need to define a rtree_tuple_definitions
   * hyper rectangle is an n dimensional rectangle
   * need callbacks
     * to generate hyper_rectangle tuple from the user_defined tuple
     * to find collective hyper_rectangle tuple from given two hyper_rectangle tuples -> minimum of the min values, and maximum of the max values
     * to find intersecting hyper_rectangle tuple from the given two hyper_rectangle tuples -> maximum of the min values, and minimum of the max values
     * to find the area of the given hyper_rectangle tuple
   * iterators to find the intersecting hyper_rectangle tuples OR containing hyper_rectangle tuples
   * all interior nodes store a hyper rectangle and a corresponding page_id, and atleast 2 entries must fit on a page, else rttd contruction fails. yet you can have any number of dimensions.
   * you can also specify any numeral datatype for dimension, as long as it is supported by the TupleStore.
   * there can be any number of dimensions, as long as 2 the user's tuple fit on leaf page and 2 interior entry tuples fit on a page
   * build utility function to check that hyper rectangle does not have a negative dimension (i.e. lower_bound <= upper_bound), construct hyper_rectangle covering 2 or more hyper rectangles, and check if a hyper_rectangle intersects with another hyper_rectangle etc.
   * keys will have a even count and all of numeral types, for ith dimension lower bound would be 2*i th key element and 2*i+1 will be upper bound, up to d dimentions (0 <= i < 2*d).

FAR FUTURE TASKS AND CONCEPTS
  * implement borrow_from_left and borrow_from_right functions for interior pages and leaf pages to be performed while merges
   * this will be implemented for variable length keys aswell
   * this will take parent page, left page and right page as input and will perform a borrow to make left and right pages balanced if it is possible by the use of borrowing
   * since this function will also modify the parent page, do relese lock on the parent page also if this operation succeeds
   * these functions will be called inside the merge_and unlock_pages_up right before we attempt to merge
   * if the borrowing succeeds we can directly release locks on all the three pages, pop the parent from the locked pages stack and break out of this loop
 * OPTIMIZATION in suffix truncation :: handle cases if INT, UINT, LARGE_UINT, BIT_FIELD, in loop 1, if unequal on ASC-> then set element to last_tuple_page1 element + 1 (to min element if NULL), if unequal on DESC-> then set element to last_tuple_page1 element - 1, if the last_tuple_page1_element is not the min value, else set it to NULL
